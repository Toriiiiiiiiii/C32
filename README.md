# C32 - 32-Bit Fantasy Computer

## 1. Introduction
The C32 is a 32-bit fantasy computer with a custom processor and video driver. Included in this repository is the [source code for the emulator](emu/src/), as well as a [text file containing the inital specification and design of the C32](spec.txt). The C32 is designed for an educational purpose, giving a simplified architecture for people to study alongside detailed and intuitive documentation. For a personal goal, I am attempting to write a functional operating system for the C32 with filesystem support.
